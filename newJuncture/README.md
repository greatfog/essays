.ve-media https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/iiif/info/uwmphoto/310/manifest.json height=300px right
Golda Meir Library are the heart of UWM, providing critical resources and services to our 24,000 students and over 1,500 faculty and instructional staff. We have Archive,  American Geographical Society Library, Special Collections, Curriculum Collection that host lots of physical collections. The Digital Collections include over 190,000 photographic images, maps, and books drawn from these collections.   

Here is a picture of Golda Meir Library taken in 1974. 




# Book on open shelve 
The Chinese study section of the library located on the 3rd floor of the library. It has 2 to 3 shelves of books of Chinese culture research in both Chinese and English. Among hundreds of books about Chinese history, such as the 2nd world war, the Qing dynasty, I also find a large collection of Chinese archaeology journal, and several volumes of 地方志, a special type of book that covers thousands years of history of a town/county. There are a lot of contents to be explored if you are interested in Chinese history and language.

Besides the hundreds of physical books on the shelves, I think the more precious collection of Chinese culture in the library is hosted in the form of digital collection. The Digital Collections at the UWM Libraries include over 190,000 photographic images, maps, and books drawn from the collections of the American Geographical Society Library, the Archives, Special Collections, and the Curriculum Collection. The web address is  https://uwm.edu/lib-collections/. Following are several digital collections that focus on Chinese history and culture.

## Forman photos cross several collections      
==Harrison Forman=={Q19878275} is a very famous journalist. He spent a lot of time in China during the 2nd world war, and interviewed very important politicians and generals of the time. We have received quite few calls and vistists from Chinese researchers requesting copies of photos he took in China.
